The Yummy Picker application manage items in a wish list. You can add and delete items to your wishlist, and they are stored in a database.
When wish list items come from the YummyRation Online Store, then the Yummy Picker can request and store additional information (Price / Rating)


This sample web application uses
- Node.js (runtime)
- Express (web app framework)
- Jade (UI templates)
- Bootstrap (UI for web and mobile apps)
- MongoDB (data management)
- Restler (REST API calls)

Need an up and running YummyRation app to use REST API calls
